## Welcome welcome!

I actually made a blog with a pretty theme! Thanks to [J Pescador](https://github.com/jpescador/hugo-future-imperfect), who created this theme. I created this during a [conservation data lab](https://rswaty.github.io/TheCDL/) (CDL) meeting.

## Trying out pictures

[Earth Data Science](https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/earth-analytics/document-your-science/add-images-to-rmarkdown-report/) gave me very helpful information on how to put in a picture.

And look! I'm too powerful :)
