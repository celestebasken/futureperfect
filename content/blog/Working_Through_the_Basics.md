Back into R! I've been pretty busy but I'm going to work on figuring this all out. Randy shared a cleaned up version of the LANDFIRE Repository and very kindly explained what all of the labels mean. It looks like a really cool dataset! I can't wait to get into it.

I'm still trying to set this blog up and figure out how to do more practical things in R. I copied a line from Randy's code and made this 'journal' theme. Hopefully as I go I'll find new cool themes and learn how to customize it even more. 

I just added a couple lines of ideas for final projects for this LANDFIRE NE Disturbance dataset to the cleaned version Randy sent me. I spent way too much time trying to figure out how to push it to GitHub and commit it with a message. I think maybe it worked? It kept saying that there was nothing new to add, and finally I clicked "stage" while just messing with random things and it sent I think? I hope I didn't mess it up. 

UPDATE: On the GitHub website it says the commit is there! I'm very excited.

My other goal today in R is to isolate parts of the rawData dataset from the LANDFIRE document and take a closer look at certain ecosystems that interest me. I want to find ones in my local area of DC/ Maryland. 

SWIRL taught me a lot about isolating parts of datasets so hopefully my SWIRL cheatsheet will help. Speaking of which, one project that I want to try is connecting my SWIRL cheatsheet to this journal. Maybe tomorrow.
