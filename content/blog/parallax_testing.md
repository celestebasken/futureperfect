title: Creating a Parallax Scroll Document
type: post
---

I'm on my third try to make a parallax scroll document for national fire disturbance data. I had some file management issues with the first two but I think I've figured out generally how it works.

I'm following [Martin Chan's](https://github.com/martinctc/parallaxr) tutorial and he uses the package parallaxr.

The parallax actually seems pretty simple with the package, but I have to make charts and maps in their own HTMLs, which may take a little bit more manuvering. It should be fun!
