I'm Celeste, a high school student from just outside the nation's capital who's learning R with thanks to Randy Swaty and the Conservation Data Lab team. 

## This blog

The main purpose of this blog is to document my journey and help me keep track of accomplishments, bugs and anything else that will be useful for future reference.
