      <description>First post of 2021! Today I wanted to share some updates on old maps, talk about my projects and goals in the spirit of the New Year, and show what I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on.
After I sent Randy my map from Hexbin Maps and Choropleths, he fixed it up a bit and here is the final version.
Definitely looks a lot better, and I hope to keep improving.
As for the my leaRning goals (stole that from Randy) for this year, here&amp;rsquo;s a snippet of what I was thinking:</description>

      <description>Here are a couple things to check for if/ when I&amp;rsquo;m having R trouble. This is certainly not an exhaustive list and it only includes issues I&amp;rsquo;ve seen before, but I hope this will be a productive way to keep track of things I run into time and time again.
When referencing files doesn&amp;rsquo;t work
 Set the working directory to the main folder and try again.  setwd()  Check spelling!</description>

      <description>I haven&amp;rsquo;t blogged in a little while, but I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on choropleths! I hit a wall with some Mac-update related issues but luckily Randy was able to help me out and I seem to be past those.
Today I made my very first (successful) choropleth, which was a hexbin map of the continental United States, using data from the LANDFIRE Team of historical fire prevalence state-by-state and the overall acres burned.</description>

      <title>Creating a Parallax Scroll Document</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m on my third try to make a parallax scroll document for national fire disturbance data. I had some file management issues with the first two but I think I&amp;rsquo;ve figured out generally how it works.
I&amp;rsquo;m following Martin Chan&amp;rsquo;s tutorial and he uses the package parallaxr.
The parallax actually seems pretty simple with the package, but I have to make charts and maps in their own HTMLs, which may take a little bit more manuvering.</description>

      <title>Fixing graphs and things</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a little while since I blogged and I created some graphs! Today I&amp;rsquo;m just cleaning them up and fixing issues, like bunched-up letters or skinny lines.
I learned more about R bar graphs, which was nice because I&amp;rsquo;ve been using them without really understanding what they do. I still don&amp;rsquo;t fully understand each piece, but I figured out enough to insert the line
width=&amp;quot;1&amp;quot; into my ggplot2 graph. I tried changing the theme, but that didn&amp;rsquo;t work and said it couldn&amp;rsquo;t find the function.</description>

      <description>knitr::opts_chunk$set(message=FALSE,warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE) Introduction to R I began learning R using the SWIRL package over the summer. Now I want to try more data work for the Nature Conservancy and the Conservation Data Lab.
Testing out my own dataframe I wanted to make a data set to mess around with, so I made up some data about my friends&#39; family since they have a lot of kids and a lot of dogs.</description>
