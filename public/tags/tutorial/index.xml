      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a little while since I blogged and I created some graphs! Today I&amp;rsquo;m just cleaning them up and fixing issues, like bunched-up letters or skinny lines.
I learned more about R bar graphs, which was nice because I&amp;rsquo;ve been using them without really understanding what they do. I still don&amp;rsquo;t fully understand each piece, but I figured out enough to insert the line
width=&amp;quot;1&amp;quot; into my ggplot2 graph. I tried changing the theme, but that didn&amp;rsquo;t work and said it couldn&amp;rsquo;t find the function.</description>

      <description>knitr::opts_chunk$set(message=FALSE,warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE) Introduction to R I began learning R using the SWIRL package over the summer. Now I want to try more data work for the Nature Conservancy and the Conservation Data Lab.
Testing out my own dataframe I wanted to make a data set to mess around with, so I made up some data about my friends&#39; family since they have a lot of kids and a lot of dogs.</description>
